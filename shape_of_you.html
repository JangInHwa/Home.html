		<p>
			The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
			So the bar is where I go<br>
			Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
			Drinking fast and then we talk slow<br>
			Come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
			And trust me I'll give it a chance now<br>
			Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
			And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Girl, you know I want your love<br>
			Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
			Come on now, follow my lead<br>
			I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
			Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
			Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
			Come on now, follow my lead<br>
			Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
			We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
			Although my heart is falling too<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			And last night you were in my room<br>
			And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
			Every day discovering something brand new<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Every day discovering something brand new<br>
			I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
		</p>

			One week in we let the story begin<br>
			We're going out on our first date<br>
			You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>
			Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br>
			We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
			And how your family is doing okay<br>
			Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>
			Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like<br>
		</p>
