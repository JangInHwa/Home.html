		<p>
			We are, we are, we are<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer<br>
			Sundown and they all come out<br>
			Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers<br>
			The party's on, so they're headin' downtown<br>
			('Round here) everybody's lookin' for a come up<br>
			And they wanna know what you're about<br>
			Me in the middle with the one I love and<br>
			We're just tryna figure everything out<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			We don't fit in well<br>
			'Cause we are just ourselves<br>
			I could use some help<br>
			Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah<br>
			You look stunning, dear<br>
			So don't ask that question here<br>
			This is my only fear, that we become<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Beautiful people Drop top, designer clothes<br>
			Front row at fashion shows<br>
			"What d'you do?" And, "Who d'you know?"<br>
			Inside the world of beautiful people<br>
			Champagne and rolled-up notes<br>
			Prenups and broken homes<br>
			Surrounded, but still alone<br>
			Let's leave the party<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			That's not who we are<br>
			(We are, we are, we are)<br>
			We are not beautiful<br>
			Yeah, that's not who we are<br>
			(We are, we are, we are)<br>
			We are not beautiful<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			L.A. mm Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)<br>
			I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (all night)<br>
			I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras (uh)<br>
			'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			We don't fit in well<br>
			We are just ourselves<br>
			I could use some help<br>
			Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah<br>
